Staticshape is a tool for automatically shaping a fully static site into an SSG site.

## What is an SSG

A Static Site Generator (SSG) is a tool used by developers to manage a static website. This helps maintain all of the benefits of static (secure, performance, flexibility) and adds a layer of additional benefits:

- Maintainable
- Data and markup separated
- CMS editable (See [CloudCannon](https://cloudcannon.com/)).

In essence the content for the website is stored in markdown, yaml, json, toml and html. The websites markup is generated with variables, loops, conditionals, shared layouts and shared components. Using an SSG over a purely static site is essential for any site larger than one page.

Using an SSG is more popular than ever and gives enormous benefits to the developers, content editors and end users of the website. Migrating your existing website to an SSG can take a long time, especially if you have a large number of pages. Transitioning to an SSG is even more daunting if you have more than one website. 

## What is the goal of Staticshape

Staticshape is designed to streamline mass migrations from any site to your SSG of choice. Staticshape reads a folder containing your static site and turns your pages into data and layouts accordingly.
