A tree is an array of nodes which contain metadata about themselves. Some nodes have metadata which represents an more nodes within it. 

This is like a [DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model) but with some additional node types. These additional types will allow us to represent the following items:

1. Variables
   - Text variables
   - Markdown variables
   - Inline markdown variables
2. Loops
3. Conditionals
4. Page Content
