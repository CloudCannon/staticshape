StaticShape runs on a local directory that contains a static site, and shapes an SSG into another folder. To run StaticShape, type the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx staticshape
```

You will be prompted for:

1. A local directory that contains the static site
2. An output directory for the SSG code
3. A path to your StaticShape configuration file
4. What SSG you would like to export to
